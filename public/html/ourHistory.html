                    <p>
                        House of Hashimoto was originally founded by Japan immigrant Hiromori Hashimoto, and his wife, Manami.  The two opened their first
                        restaurant in the heart of Wake Forest, NC, at the intersection of Rogers Rd. and Forestville Rd., then called "Hashi's Diner."

                    <p>
                        Almost going out of business in their first year, the Hashimotos persevered and began developing their roots.  Originallu,
                        items on the menu focused on popular foods such udon and uramaki, advertised as "noodles" and "inside-out sushi."

                        With steady success in their humble restaurant, the couple began to grow their family, and raised Fuyuki, Akiyo, Goro, Banri,
                        and Asao.

                        The children became integral components of Hashi's Diner, and eventually came to manage the entire operation.  With Fuyuki's
                        vision and leadership, she and all of her siblings saved most of their earnings with the hope to one day expand on their
                        parents' dreams in coming to the U.S.  The children meticulously planned to grow the business, expanding their menu items to
                        integrate more authentic Japanese flavors.

                        A major shift occurred.  The Hashimoto family pivotted their business to invite a larger audience, while also embracing their
                        Japanese heritage.  They closed down Hashi's Diner and set a new <a href="hoursDirections.html" class="timeline-link">location</a>, 
                        right in the heart of North Carolina.  The <a href="overallMenu.html" class="timeline-link">menu</a> was upgraded to cater an 
                        audience with a refined pallete and intrigue for authentic Japanese cuisine.  And while Hiromori
                        and Manami passed away before they could witness the fruits of their children's labor, they are forever remembered.  Namely,
                        with the new location, the business was renamed House of Hashimoto in honor of Hiromori and Manami.

                    <p>
                        Right in the middle of downtown Raleigh on Front End Road, House of Hashimoto was become one of the city's premiere restaurants for
                        Japanese gourmet.  Fuyuki continues to manage daily operations, now with the help of her daughter, Fumi, and husband, Atomo.  The
                        restaurant now leads a staff over over 200 individuals for it's single location, and serves a wide <a href="gallery.html"
                        class="timeline-link">selection</a> of sake, teas, and
                        traditional Japanese foods.
                        In an effort to provide true authenticity, all food items and ingredients on the menu are directly sourced from Japan.  Be sure
                        to reserve your table and visit on Fridays and Saturday for live performances featuring the koto, Japan's national instrument.

            <p>
                When you dine in House of Hashimoto, you may find the menu items described in the native tongue.  What you may know as a "california
                roll" may be described as an inside-out sushi roll.  However, it is truly called uramaki.  That being said, we graciously invite you
                to come enjoy, appreciate, and learn about our authentic Japanese cuisine.  Our staff members are highly skilled and knowledgeable, and
                are more than happy to provide you a 5-star experience you'll never forget.
